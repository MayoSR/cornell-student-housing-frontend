## Ithaca Subleasing Web Application

### Project Goal
Develop a website that provides people with a platform to advertise or identify subleases in Ithaca.

### Project Objectives
* Post a sublease with information about the property, including address and pictures
* Search for subleased properties based on user-defined filters.
* Provide reputation and review ratings for users posting subleases.
* Implement reporting system to mitigate inappropriate listings, users, and behaviors. 
* Ability to differentiate between Cornell University users with a NetID and other guest users. 
* Provide contact information between sublessor and sublessee. 
* Track a list of sublease listings.
* Implement a feedback system so that users can rate their experience with the platform.

### Key Stakeholders
* Ithaca sublessors (includes Cornell University students)
* Ithaca sublessees (includes Cornell University students)

### Risks and assumptions
* Cornell student information is kept confidential (only netID, repuation and reviews are visible)
* Explicit content could be posted.
* Fake listings can surface.
* Inter-personal relations between subleassor and subleasee could pose risks
